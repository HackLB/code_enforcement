    "description": "Harvelle's Long Beach was in The Edge newspaper as providing entertainment. I researched to see if they had an entertainment license and they don't have any licenses for Harvelle's. The only license I see at that location is for Congregation Ale House. According to their website, they are still open and have events coming up. ",
