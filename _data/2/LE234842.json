    "description": "CUST CAME IN UPSET TO 4TH FLOOR EXPRESSING THIS WAS HIS THIRD TIME COMING INTO THE OFFICE TO REQ HIS SITE ADDRESS CHANGED ON HIS LICENSE. WHEN LOOKING INTO HIS CURRENT ACCOUNT BU21319470 I EXPLAINED TO CUST ONLY HIS MAILING ADDRESS HAD BEEN UPDATED AND HE WOULD NEED TO SUBMIT NEW APP REFLECTING THAT ADDRESS CHANGE. WHEN I INFORMED CUST OF THE PROCESSING FEE HE BECAME UPSET AND SAID HE DID NOT WANT TO PAY THAT FEE, I THEN INFORMED CUST I COULD NOT CHANGE THE SITE ADDRESS WITHOUT THE NEW APP OR FEE. HE THEN ASKED IF HIS CURRENT LICENSE WAS IN GOOD STANDING, WHICH I INFORMED THAT HIS CURRENT LICENSE FOR PREVIOUS LOCATION WAS ACTIVE HE WALKED AWAY SAYING HE WAS NOT GOING TO APPPLY FOR NEW LICENSE. ",
