    "description": "Cirivellos applied for their Business License back in January 2016. They currently do not have any outstanding inspections or taxes and fees. They still have failed to submit their ABC license with conditions or their SBOE. After speaking with them regarding their Restaurant license and entertainment license (both currently pending) they have said that they may be submitting another new application due to yet another change of ownership. They have not gotten back to me every time I have reached out. Check both main business license log and entertainment license log for my comments.",
