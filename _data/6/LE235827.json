    "description": "El Paisa Family Restaurant currently has a business license for restaurant with alcoholÂ located at 1640 Orange Ave. They are looking to expand into the adjacent property next door (I believe it is the old Liberty Fellowship building). Planning has determined that they cannot expand due to that property not being zoned for a restaurant use. El Paisa then contacted the Council District to try and circumvent the system. I forwarded along the business license and ABC licenses to the council district office and let them know that if El Paisa begins to operate at another location outside of their current license illegally, they will be cited. Please visit the property to determine if they are operating at the adjacent location.",
